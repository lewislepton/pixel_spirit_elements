if you get the chance, purchase a deck & support the artist.


# HOW TO USE IT

you need [kode studio](https://github.com/Kode/KodeStudio/releases) & simply drag & drop the project folder into it & run a the project. you can use visual studio code if you so wish, but thats a bit more of a work around to get up & running with kha.

to change the shader, go to the `setupShader()` function & find where the fragment shader is set in the pipeline.
